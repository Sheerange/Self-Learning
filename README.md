# Targeted confidence optimization (TCO)

This project is implementation for: ***”Mix-supervised Learning: A Self-Learning Strategy for Facilitating Data Utilization and Robust Representation“***. In this work, inspired by human learning, we propose mixed supervised learning and give a self-learning training phase to solve this challenge.
